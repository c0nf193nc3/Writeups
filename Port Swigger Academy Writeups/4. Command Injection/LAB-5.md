# Lab-5: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration
## LAB Description - 
This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function. The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain. To solve the lab, execute the whoami command and exfiltrate the output via a DNS query to Burp Collaborator. You will need to enter the name of the current user to complete the lab.

## Solution - 

`This LAB needs Pro Version, will provide the solution soon`
