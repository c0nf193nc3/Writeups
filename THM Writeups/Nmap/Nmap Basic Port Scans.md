# Nmap Basic Port Scans
## Task 2 (TCP and UDP Ports) - 
* Which service uses UDP port 53 by default?
 = DNS
* Which service uses TCP port 22 by default?
 = SSH
* How many port states does Nmap consider?
 = 6
* Which port state is the most interesting to discover as a pentester?
 = Open
## Task 3 (TCP Flags) - 
* What 3 letters represent the Reset flag?
 = RST
* Which flag needs to be set when you initiate a TCP connection (first packet of TCP 3-way handshake)?
 = SYN
## Task 4 (TCP Connect Scan) - 
* Launch the VM. Open the AttackBox and execute nmap -sT MACHINE_IP via the terminal. A new service has been installed on this VM since our last scan. Which port number was closed in the scan above but is now open on this target VM?
 = 110
* What is Nmap’s guess about the newly installed service?
 = POP3
## Task 5 (TCP SYN Scan) - 
* Launch the VM. Some new server software has been installed since the last time we scanned it. On the AttackBox, use the terminal to execute nmap -sS MACHINE_IP. What is the new open port?
 = 6667
* What is Nmap’s guess of the service name?
 = IRC
## Task 6 (UDP Scan) - 
* Launch the VM. On the AttackBox, use the terminal to execute nmap -sU -F -v MACHINE_IP. A new service has been installed since the last scan. What is the UDP port that is now open?
 = 53
* What is the service name according to Nmap?
 = domain
## Task 7 (Fine-Tuning Scope and Performance) - 
* What is the option to scan all the TCP ports between 5000 and 5500?
 = -p5000-5500
* How can you ensure that Nmap will run at least 64 probes in parallel?
 = --min-parallelism=64
* What option would you add to make Nmap very slow and paranoid?
 = -T0
